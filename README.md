# ðŸ–Œ SMPLnote

A simple web application for taking notes in Markdownâ¬‡ using

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [simpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/)
* [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)

### Initial problem set

* Create functions for adding a new note
* Save note list using the DOM `localStorage` API
* List each note in the sidebar

### Additional problems

* Add titles to notes & field to change that title
* Create functions for deleting note

### Project notes

Unfortunately _the styling of lists (unordered & ordere)_ is messed up & isn't shown properly anymore. For now, the editor buttons corresponding to those functions are hidden. Additionally a little info button is displayed, that shows "Note: Lists aren't working properly atm." as a tooltip.
